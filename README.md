# PRODIGY_ML_02

The task for the second project of Prodigy Infotech's Machine Learning Internship is to create a KMeans clustering and using that to identify the trends in sales of a retail store. 

I have used [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadtalib786/retail-sales-dataset) Dataset from Kaggle. 

Attached is Jupyter notebook with code as well as documentation explaining in detail how to achieve the desired output. 

I have also attached the outputs for this particular KMeans clustering. 

KMeans Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that can be executed by following the given steps.

Steps:

> choose the number of clusters as K. 

> Assign K random points. 

> Assign all the other points to a cluster based on the least distance with a point as K.

> Find the mean of each cluster K. 

> Assign the K points to each of the means. 

> Repeat until there is no change in the clusters.
